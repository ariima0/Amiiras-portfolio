    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I’m Amiira, a second-year Software Engineering student at Sheffield Hallam University. I only started coding in 2024, so my journey into tech is still very new, but in this short time, I’ve learned a lot and made real progress. Transitioning into software development after planning to study psychology wasn’t easy. I had to quickly adapt to thinking logically, understanding programming concepts, and building projects from scratch.</p>

      <p>Despite starting later than some of my peers, I’ve worked hard to develop skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Git, and I’ve successfully completed several projects on my own and in groups. I’ve also learned how to tackle challenges like debugging, integrating APIs, and creating fully functioning applications, all while building my confidence in coding.</p>

      <p>What makes me a strong candidate for a placement is my <strong>quick learning mindset, adaptability, and commitment to growth</strong>. I’m not afraid to step out of my comfort zone, experiment with new technologies, and put in the extra effort to get things done. Even though I only started coding recently, I’ve proven that I can learn quickly, work independently, and contribute meaningfully to a team.</p>
